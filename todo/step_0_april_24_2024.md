* Start a surrealdb server and save that server to a file so that it is persistent
* mock up the grocery products that I will pretend to read from the website {Description, Price}
* create the recipes for the meals I want to plan for the 3 days
* design the recipe table that i will have in surrealdb
* write code that can take the recipes and put them in surrealdb
* implement the recipe in code 
* pass the mocked grocery products to llama3 and capture the return
